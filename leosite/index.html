          <h3>Cross-Industry Range</h3>

          <p>From founding through IPO/M&A at scale. Not theory — lived operational experience across the full company lifecycle, from first dollar raised to nine-figure exits.</p>
          <h3>Category Creation</h3>
          <p>Building markets when there are no benchmarks, no comparables, and no existing customer mental models. Educating markets that don't yet know they need what you're building.</p>
